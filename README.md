# TETRIX MANIA

This is a fresh look at the world-famous and beloved puzzle game from childhood. Stack the falling figures by filling the rows with them to clear the field and earn points. The more rows you clear at a time, the more points you earn.

### Features:
- New gaming experience with Full 3D and parallax.

### Core mechanic:
Random figures consisting of 1x1 blocks fall from above into a rectangular glass with a width of 10x20 cells. In flight, the player can rotate the figure by 90 Â° and move it horizontally. You can also accelerate its fall when it has already been decided where the figure should fall. The figure falls until it hits another figure or the bottom of the glass. If at the same time the blocks fill a horizontal row of 10 cells, then this row is cleared, and all the blocks located above are lowered one cell below. In this case, the player is awarded points. The more rows a player clears at a time, the more points he will get.
The pace of the game gradually accelerates. The game ends when a new figure cannot fit into the glass.
